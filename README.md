## What you can and cannot do with my code

FireClient is open source but ARR (All Rights Reserved) so people don't steal my work.

Feel free to read it, learn from it, or use it as a basis for your own projects (within reason). I just don't want theft. Please use this as a tool for your learning, I would love that ðŸ˜Š

You may also fork the project, but not redistribute modified versions. If you want to add features, just submit a PR! I would love to help! You will even get Affiliate status (just a custom nametag text color for now)
